# Camel-and-Banana-Puzzle

It is a famous puzzle problem and has been asked many times in a tech interview.In thsi problem a man has to carry some 

loads of banana from one place to another and for every kilometer camel eats a banana, so we have to find maximium no. of

banana we can carry to the destination.

In this problem we will have to cover the distances with some stoppage in between, i.e we will have to carry some banana 

to intermediate locations and then to the destination.

I have just coded the solution in C++.

On execting the code 

it first asks no.of banana,then total distance,then capacity of the camel,then no of banana required to cover 1km

then it will generate the no of banana required along with the no of stoppage in between.

Hope You all like my code. Please do give Star to my repository if you like it.


Thanks..
